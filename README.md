Startup Management System
=========================

Overview
--------

The Startup Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate and streamline the entire lifecycle of startup programs. It serves multiple stakeholders including entrepreneurs, sponsors, reviewers, and administrators, providing dedicated tools for each of them to contribute, collaborate, and manage their respective responsibilities effectively.

The system follows a microservices architecture, ensuring that each major functionality is decoupled, scalable, and independently deployable. This architecture enhances maintainability and allows the system to handle high traffic and evolving feature requirements.


Core Functional Modules
-----------------------

### 1\. Authentication & User Management Service (Shared Module)

This module handles the authentication and authorization across the entire system. It ensures that users are securely logged in using OAuth-based authentication (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn), generates and validates JWT tokens, and enforces role-based access control (RBAC).

The user management part allows users to maintain personal profiles, while administrators can assign and update roles (Entrepreneur, Reviewer, Sponsor, Admin). All other services depend on this module to verify user identity and permissions.


### 2\. Startup Call Management Service

This service allows administrators to manage and promote startup calls. It includes:

-   Tools to publish startup call details on the website and integrate with social media channels.
-   Features to schedule and manage promotional events, deadlines, and important dates through an events calendar.
-   Management interface to create, update, or delete startup calls and associated promotional materials.

Entrepreneurs can browse and view active startup calls, understanding deadlines and requirements.


### 3\. Sponsorship Management Service

The sponsorship module is responsible for handling relationships with potential sponsors:

-   Administrators can create sponsorship opportunities and send out calls for sponsorships.
-   Sponsors have a dedicated dashboard to view available sponsorship packages, monitor their donations, track sponsored projects, and see expected returns.
-   Transparent financial tracking ensures sponsors can see how their contributions are being utilized.
-   Communication tools to engage sponsors regarding new opportunities.


### 4\. Startup Idea Submission & Evaluation Service

This is the central module for startup applicants:

-   Entrepreneurs submit their startup ideas via a well-structured portal, aided by provided guidelines and templates to ensure high-quality submissions.
-   A criteria-based assessment system is integrated, where each idea is evaluated based on predefined scoring metrics.
-   An automated reviewer assignment system aligns each submission with a suitable reviewer, considering their expertise and availability.
-   Reviewers follow a formal review workflow, providing scores and feedback.
-   Applicants are informed about their acceptance or rejection status with structured feedback, encouraging learning and improvement.


### 5\. Project Tracking & Management Service

Once a startup idea is accepted, it enters the project tracking phase:

-   Accepted startups are given access to project management tools, allowing them to plan tasks, define milestones, and set timelines.
-   A visual dashboard presents a clear view of each startup's progress, highlighting achieved milestones and pending tasks.
-   Both administrators and sponsors can monitor project progress through real-time updates.


### 6\. Financial Planning & Budget Allocation Service

Financial transparency and efficiency are key to the success of startup programs:

-   Budget planning tools allow administrators and startups to define and manage budgets for specific startup calls.
-   Real-time expenditure tracking ensures startups stay within their budget limits.
-   Analytical tools provide financial insights, enabling better resource allocation.


### 7\. Communication & Collaboration Tools Service

Effective communication between stakeholders is crucial:

-   Secure messaging channels and discussion boards connect startups with mentors, sponsors, and investors.
-   A knowledge-sharing section offers learning resources, best practices, and documentation, fostering collaboration and professional growth.


### 8\. Notification & Result Announcement Service

This service handles the automated announcement and notification process:

-   Entrepreneurs receive notifications regarding the status of their startup submissions (accepted/rejected).
-   Public announcements of accepted startups are made via a dedicated section on the platform, increasing visibility and attracting interest.
-   Notifications are also used to inform stakeholders about upcoming deadlines, events, or sponsorship opportunities.


### 9\. Reporting & Analytics Service

Data-driven decision-making is facilitated through:

-   Performance analytics that provide insights into submission rates, acceptance rates, and sponsor engagement.
-   Custom reporting tools allow administrators and sponsors to generate detailed reports on various metrics, including financial summaries, project progress, and participant statistics.


Architectural Overview
----------------------

The system follows a **Microservices Architecture**:

-   Each functional module is a standalone service, independently deployable and scalable.
-   Services communicate via lightweight protocols (e.g., REST or message queues), ensuring low coupling and high flexibility.
-   A **Shared Authentication Service** ensures centralized and consistent user identity management across all services.
-   A **Monorepo** structure is preferred to maintain all microservices in a single codebase, simplifying dependency management, version control, and deployment workflows.


Key Roles & User Groups
-----------------------

1.  **Entrepreneurs**\
    Submit startup ideas, view call announcements, manage accepted projects, and receive evaluation results.

2.  **Reviewers**\
    Assigned to assess startup submissions, provide ratings and feedback, and participate in the evaluation process.

3.  **Sponsors**\
    View sponsorship opportunities, monitor their financial contributions, track sponsored projects, and access analytical reports.

4.  **Administrators**\
    Manage users, startup calls, sponsorship opportunities, reviewer assignments, project tracking, budgets, and system-wide settings.


Security Considerations
-----------------------

Security is a top priority:

-   OAuth-based authentication ensures secure, password-less logins.
-   JWT tokens are used for session management and authorization checks.
-   RBAC policies prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
-   Data validation, sanitization, and encryption techniques are applied to safeguard user data.
-   Regular audits and logging mechanisms are in place to monitor system activity.


Future Enhancements
-------------------

-   Multi-language support for broader accessibility.
-   Integration with payment gateways for advanced sponsorship transactions.
-   Enhanced AI-driven applicant screening.
-   Mobile application interfaces for on-the-go access.
